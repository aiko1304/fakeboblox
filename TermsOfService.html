        <p>
            Welcome to ROBLOX! You have entered what we like to call the Imagination Platform, the ultimate virtual universe where imagination rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together with you and the rest of our community, we want to create the future of entertainment. To accomplish this, we set out below the terms and conditions (“<b>Terms</b>”) that you and we must follow, and are a legally binding agreement between you and Roblox Corporation (“<b>ROBLOX</b>”, “<b>we</b>” or “<b>us</b>”). 
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, we want to point out that by accepting these terms, you and Roblox are agreeing to <i>arbitrate any dispute and you are giving up your right to go to court</i> either individually (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court) or as part of a class action. See the Dispute Resolution and Arbitration section below for details.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also want to make sure that you know that by accepting these terms, you’re agreeing to <i>grant us a license to use, online and offline</i>, whatever you create or in the past have created on our service (<i>such as making and selling content or items</i>). This is covered in the User Generated Content section below. We hope you have fun!

You and we agree to arbitrate all disputes (except those exceptions specifically set out in the next subsection) between you and us or our affiliates, except disputes related to our intellectual property rights. “<b>Disputes</b>” means any dispute, action, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal or equitable basis, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms.

                            <li><u>Informal Negotiations</u>. To help get you and us to a resolution and to control costs for you and us regarding any dispute, you and we agree to first attempt to informally discuss and try to negotiate a resolution to any Dispute (except the Disputes specifically set out below) for at least 60 days from when notice of the dispute is sent. Those informal negotiations will commence upon written notice from you to us or us to you. We will send our notice to your registered email address and and any billing address that you provided to us. You will send your notice to Roblox Corporation, Legal Department, 60 E 3rd Ave #115, San Mateo, CA 94401. After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration. If the dispute cannot be resolved within that time period, and if either you or we desire to continue the dispute, the party desiring to continue the dispute shall commence arbitration.</li>
                            <li><u>Commencing Arbitration</u>. If you and we do not resolve a dispute by informal negotiation, the dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration before a neutral arbitrator whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY AND GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO A CLASS ACTION. Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the “<b>AAA</b>”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and its Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “<b>AAA Rules</b>”). You can find more information at www.adr.org or by calling 800-778-7879. Arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. The arbitrator may award damages to you individually as a court could, including declaratory or injunctive relief, but only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.</li>
                            <li><u>Fees and Location</u>. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, we will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Mateo County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse us for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</li>
